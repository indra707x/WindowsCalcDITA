This is my first sample project to demonstrate my DITA authoring skills.

The topic of the project is very simple— 'Basic Arithmatic Operations Using Windows Calculator'. Through this short project, I intend to demonstrate my fundamental skills in authroing using DITA. The authoring tool used is— Oxygen XML Author. The project also showcases my graphical skills— for this, I have used the SnagIT tool. 

I will be covering the following four (4) basic arithmatic operations in this help documentation— Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
